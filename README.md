### Python for Data Analysis
    Data Analysis is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming data with the purpose of extracting initial knowledge and insights from a data set.
    1/ Numpy:   A Python library that supports multi-dimensional arrays
    2/ Pandas:  A Python library that manipulates and analyze data in a form of a table

### Python for Data Visualization
    Data Visualization helps informational communication in a clear and effective way to end-users such as executives, stakeholders, customers by displaying statistical graphics.
    1/ Matplotlib:  A Python 2D plotting library that produces quality figures.
    2/ Seaborn:     A Python library built on Matplotlib library that gives a high-level interface of graphics.
    3/ Pandas:      A Python library that has both characteristics of analysis and visualization.  
    4/ Plotly & Cufflinks: An interactive visualization library.
    5/ Geographical Plotting:   A library that displays geographic data visualization.

### Traditional Machine Learning Algorithm
##### Supervised Learning
    1/ Linear Regression:   used to estimate real values.
    3/ Logistic Regression: used to predict categorical targets.
    4/ K Nearest neighbor:  used to classify a point based on its closet neighbor groups.
    4/ Decision Trees:      used to classify a point based on its probability of outcomes.
    5/ Random Forest:       used to classify a point based on multiple decision trees (known as ensemble).
    6/ Support Vector Machines: used for both classification and regression challenges.
##### Unsupervised Learning
    1/ K-Means Clustering:  used to group observations into clusters where each observation belongs to the nearest cluster.
    2/ Principal Component Analysis: used to explain the variance-covariance of features through linear combinations.

### Learning along the way

### Data cleaning (preprocessing):
- Standardization, 
- Checking missing data like NAN
- Dropping or Replacing missing data
- Dropping features
- Dropping outliers
